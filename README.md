# create a conda environment from file
(all this can also be done from the interface of anaconda navigator or similar programmes, maybe from VScode?)

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`conda activate myenv`

once you have installed everything you want in the environment you can also use `conda env export > environment_droplet.yml` to export it to a yml file for the future (or other people) and then update your environment with `conda env update --file local.yml --prune`  (not sure you really need the `prune`)
